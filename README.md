# RNASeqAnalysis 
All scripts are called through the slurm.sh script. This should be done incrementally; attempted to allow for a runonce script but a few things failed. Have attempted to cater for any directories that need to be created during processing. 

Follow all the steps in the slurm.sh script (New name to be chosen soon)


Preprocessing scripts have also been added in the preprocessing directory, an example of the preprocessing output can also be found there.



There is an alternative available also, in RNASeqAnalysisOther. Some of the scripts are designed for the old job scheduler, however the higher the steps the more likely they are to be slurm orientated, so I will update these scripts to cater purely for slurm use.
