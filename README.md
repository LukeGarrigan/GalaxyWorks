All scripts are called through the slurm.sh script. This should be done incrementally; attempted to allow for a runonce script but a few things failed. Have attempted to cater for an directories that need to be created during processing. 

Follow all the steps in the slurm.sh script (New name to be chosen soon)


Preprocessing scripts to be added.
